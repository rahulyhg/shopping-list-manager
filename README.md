# shopping-list-manager-js-demo

This app can be tested here
https://meelishynninen.com/shopping/

I cloned PHP version and did it all with 'Vanilla' JavaScript ES6
https://github.com/MeelisH/shopping-list-manager

It's not connected to real DataBase like PHP version is. Items are stored in Browsers LocalStorage.
It was ment to be DEMO for PHP vesion but i will use it as main version if there are going to be any future development for this shopping app :D
